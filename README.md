# School Lunch Management System - SLMS
*The School Lunch Management System (SLMS)* is a web application that intends to help elementary schools efficiently participate in their county's school lunch program.
## Goals and Overview
* The elementary school requires their students to choose a "*hot lunch*" (served by the cafeteria) or a "cold lunch" (brought with them from home) selection for each day they are attending.
* Students can reference the county's lunch calendar published on the school website to reference upcoming lunch details (although these do change on occasion).
* If the students select a hot lunch, they are also required to *select if a parent will be attending* with them as this is an option for weeks where hot lunches are being served. 
* The elementary school tracks the selections to ensure the number of lunches prepared and the space available for attendees is adequate.  
* To assist students, teachers track the student selections for the school day to allow them to override the current selection when a student need arises (forgot their cold lunch, etc.). 
* For days where a school field trip is involved, the elementary school requires their students to choose a prepared bag lunch or to indicate that they are bringing a lunch with them from home.
* Snacks are also handed out during the day by teachers who then need to keep a tally of the number of snacks distributed to their students.
* Teachers can run reports to make sure the system accounts for all students in their class(es).  School administration can run reports to see student selection feedback, as well as to email students with information about upcoming cafeteria info.
